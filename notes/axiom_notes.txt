Intro:
- AXIOM remote is the remote control for the AXIOM Beta
- It has different buttons, rotor, LCD for the menus and options
- The hardware includes one PIC32MZ, two PIC16s and one LCD display
- The software runs "bare metal" i.e. it has minimal bootloader for processor, clock and memory and the firmware directly runs on the hardware
- Also there is no graphics acceleration so each pixel is drawn manually in the software

General Concepts:
- This picture shows the position of all the parts, the crossed things are not planned anymore
- It has a record button (REC), green buttons to select the options on the screen, there is on/off switch and one rotary knob with 12 indents and a lock/unlock slider switch
- Three types of illumination: white LED (REC button & circle buttons), RGB status LED (two on the left side near the rotor) and RGB LED (six rectangular buttons)

Operation:
- In the old design:
	- Previous or next page can be accessed by pressing the left/right buttons
	- The page number button is used to change the page
	- There are two variats:
		- First one has 4 preset values + the menu and the bottom right can be configured to save any additional option using the "edit" button on the left
		- Second one doesn't allow editing option
	- "Help" button: to know more about any label/button

- In the new design, right now only "home" and "back" buttons are available, others will be configured soon

Hardware:
- PCB Version 0.9
	- It uses PIC32MZ, ICSP, JTAG
	- (will add more later)
- PCB Version 2 prototype
	- 2nd knob is removed to simply the UI
	- Removed left side rocker switches as they are prone to accidently switched as they protrude out from the surface
	- Topside push buttons are removed too for good UI practice
	- One LED per push button is planned to show which button is active 
	- 4 more holes can be added to PCB so that the back can be firmly screwed together with the front
	- The slide switches for ON/OFF and LOCK can be replaced with pushbuttons

Electronic Components:
- PIC32MZ is chosen as the core processor, two small PIC16s are used for handling push button, rotor and the LED I/O operations
- 2.8" 320x240 TFT from Adafruit is used as the display
- USB-C connector is used 
- To detect the device orientation 3D accelerometer was planned but the remote is only to be used with one orientation so not needed
- The remote is currently powered by externally via 5V DC supply, later internal batteries can be used
- Currently the firmware is programmed with PICkit2 directly into the flash memory, later this can be done via USB (separate SD cards shall be used) 

Connectivity:
- A USB extension cable is plugged into USB connector but that can use more space so in the future USB-C or USB Mini B can be used

Extension Port:
- This allows additional devices to be connected to the remote, the purpose is to provide power and data transfer to and from the module (page 25: right side)

GUI:
This picture shows the AXIOM Remote color scheme (explain from the pic)
